# atmcash.v1

Hello and welcome to the ATMcash github. This is version 1 repositorty from the official development team. This version is a NXT clone, however, in coming versions there will be a fork over to a new codebase.

This codebase is to get the project started and moving, and isn't meant to be a long-term environment.

The project is HDD mined utilizing the BURST algorithm for now. The algo will potentially also change in the future.


GETTING STARTED

Clone or download the files. 

On windows run the 'run.bat'. On linux run the 'run.sh'.

This will start a java VM running a webserver.

In order to access the UI, simply point your browser to http://localhost:8112 once the wallet has started and connected.


This repo contains both the source files and a compiled .jar file with source's code. Instructions on how to compile code will be posted at a later date.




INFO

This entire chain is merely the beginning for the ATMcash project. We are now working on an entirely new backend containing multiple changes, and improvements of many kinds.

Stay tuned for updates regarding this and more from ATMcash Development Team.

Thank you!
